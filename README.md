$systemLanguage = "es_mx";
```

You can also modify the websites title

```

Change the default limitations for rewards and objectives to match your needs.
How does this work? My server has an strict economy system, so i decided to create limitations of how much money a single achievements can reward on completion.
You can easily change these limitations here.

Limits: Desired integrer number for limits
LimitsLength: Integrer count of Limits number selected

For example, if you choose your RewardsLimits to "1000000). You'll have to set your LimitsLengthRewards to (7), because "1000000" has SEVEN numbers.
```php
$systemLimitsObjectives             = "1000";
$systemLimitsLengthObjectives       = "4";
$systemLimitsRewards                = "10000";
$systemLimitsLengthRewards          = "5";
```

# Translations
You can modify the default translations (both available in English and Spanish) to match your needs. Simply locate the includes/lang_xx.php files and modify them as you wish
```php
$langMainTitle = "DO NOT MODIFY THE VARIABLE NAMES, ONLY TEXT";
```
